Transform a set of .xml files, destination files generated dynamically

 The many-to-dynamic mojo performs XSL transformation of a set of source files 
 into destination files, which are created dynamically by the XSL template 
 as follows:

 * For each source file, the template creates its destination file(s) dynamically
 using the <<<xsl:result-document>>> command.

 * The default output of the template is directed to a dummy file, which is deleted
 after processing.
