Using default source file in many-to-one transformation

 The single (main) source file (srcFile) in the many-to-one mojo is not mandatory.
 If not set, the mojo creates a default source file on the following path:

--- 
  target/generated-xml/xslt-generator-maven-plugin/empty.xml
---

 The default source file then has the following content:

---
  <root/>
---
