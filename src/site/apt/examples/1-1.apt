Transform a set of .xml files, each file 1:1

 The many-to-many mojo performs XSL transformation of a set of source files 
 with destination files created as follows:

 * Each source file is transformed into a single destination file, preserving
 the directory structure. The destination directory tree is created based on
 the source directory tree.

 * Files with up-to-date timestamp are skipped.
